DB3 Network is a robust and secure **decentralized data network** designed to tackle the expected problems faced by dApps. These applications frequently require the ability to **CRUD** vast amounts of user-generated data, all while maintaining a decentralized architecture. By utilizing DB3 Network, you can effortlessly create data-intensive applications such as social networking apps, gamefi, and more.

## **Guide Line of DB3**

---

- Before create your dApp, you need to create database or find the existing database you can use on **[DMS website](./build/data_manager.md)**
- Try **[Quick Start](./build/quick_start.md)** or based on **[ReactJS Demo](./build/demos/js_demo.md)** to build your dApps with DB3 Network as your decentralized database
- Since running a dApp need connect with a node, you can ether find a existing node from **[Commuity nodes](./build/node/community_node.md)** or
- Try **[Run Local Node](./build/node/run_locally.md)** to host your own nodes
<!-- - Go deeper by reading **[Network](../network/overview.md)** and the **[Advanced](../advanced/overview.md)**specification -->

## **Build dApps**

---

### **[Refer to DB3.js =>](https://github.com/dbpunk-labs/db3.js)**##

DB3 Network is a data network the same as Firestore but in a decentralized way. DApps can directly interact with DB3 Network with db3 client. A properly designed `db3.js` package allow you do the "CRUD" job in the client never be easier

## **Run DB3 Node**

---

DB3 network is community owned and everyone is ecouraged to be part of the network. You can run a DB3 node to provide data storage, compute and bandwidth for dApps and earn make a good profit from that.
