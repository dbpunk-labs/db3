We have two types of node: Normal Nodes & Validator Nodes.
Both types of node can be connected directly, the differences is that you have to sign when querying data from the validator nodes while no signiture is required when querying from normal nodes.
The normal nodes will give user a better using experience but sacrifice some data security. All the data querid from normal nodes is not verified and this means the truth of the data cannot be trusted. While validator nodes do not have a security and trust problem but you have to sign for every [Query Session]()
