# DB3 Network

DB3 Network is a Lightweight, *Permanent* JSON document database for Web3. It is designed to store and retrieve data for decentralized applications built on blockchain technology. DB3 Network has two core features:

1. Using DB3 Network as a JSON document database. 
2. Periodically rolling up the JSON document to the [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) at a very low cost.

# Have a try

## Set up self-hosted Node

**1. Start docker container**

```shell
sudo docker run -p 26639:26639 -p 26619:26619 -p 26629:26629 \
                -e ADMIN_ADDR=0xF78c...29679 \ # use your own wallet address
                -it ghcr.io/dbpunk-labs/db3:latest 
```

you should see the following output
```
start store node...
start index node...
the ar account address e_i_JLA8toEr5HaHCpkZJUIXp3kypCAd5NNAvfWNOgE
start ar testnet ...
10000000000000Start the local db3 nodes successfully
The storage node url: http://127.0.0.1:26619
The index node url: http://127.0.0.1:26639
The console url: http://127.0.0.1:26629
```

**2. Setup the node**

* open the `http://127.0.0.1:26629/` to setup your node for the first time
* open the `http://127.0.0.1:26629/database` to create database or collection
* open the `http://127.0.0.1:26629/node/dashboard` to vist the dashboard

**3. Playground**

open the `http://127.0.0.1:26629/database` to create database or collection, then go the playgound

```typescript
// create a account
const account = createRandomAccount()
// create the client
const client = createClient('http://127.0.0.1:26619',
                            'http://127.0.0.1:26639', 
                             account)

// get the collection
// please replace the database address and collection name with yours
const collection = await getCollection("0xF7..79", "book", client)

// add a document
const {id} = await addDoc(collection, {
                name:"The Three-Body Problem"ï¼Œ
                author:"Cixin-Liu",
                rate:"4.8"} as Book)
// query the document
const resultSet = await queryDoc<Book>(collection, "/[author=Cixin-Liu]")
```

if you have any questions, please feel free to ask us for help and you can find more detail about the example
* the doc for [createClient](https://docs.db3.network/functions/createClient.html)
* the doc about [queryDoc](https://docs.db3.network/functions/queryDoc.html)


# Try Our Cloud Sandbox

* [Console](https://console.cloud.db3.network/console/home):https://console.cloud.db3.network/console/home
* Data Rollup Node: https://rollup.cloud.db3.network
* Data Index Node: https://index.cloud.db3.network

You can connect to the Data Rollup Node and Data Index Node with db3.js

Note: the cloud sandbox is just for testing and unstable

# How it works

The DB3 Network has two roles:

1. The **Data Rollup Node** accepts write operations, compresses the data, rolls it up to Arweave, and stores the metadata in the smart contract.
2. The **Data Index Node** synchronizes data from the Data Rollup Node in real-time or recovers the index with metadata in the smart contract and files in Arweave. It serves the index as a queryable API.

To prevent tampering, every 
JSON document must be signed by its owner. Only the owner can update or delete the JSON document.

If you want us to support the other public chains, just give us an [issue](https://github.com/dbpunk-labs/db3/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=)

# What can we build with the db3 network?

Now building a fully on-chain application is an easy thing. You can create a fully on-chain game or a fully on-chain social network, or any other application you desire.

# FAQ

Q: Is the DB3 Network a blockchain?

A: No, the DB3 Network is not a blockchain. It is simply a developer tool that can be hosted locally or used through our cloud service.

Q: What are the differences between MongoDB and DB3 Network?

A: MongoDB uses centralized data storage, whereas DB3 Network uses decentralized data storage. Additionally, DB3 Network ensures that data is permanently available.

Q: Will my data be lost if the Data Rollup Node or Data Index Node is not available?

A: No, you can set up your data index node and recover your data from the blockchain.
