# What's DB3 Network

DB3 Network is an open-source decentralized firebase firestore alternative to build dapps quickly with minimal engineering effort.

# Why DB3 Network

![why db3](./docs/images/why_db3.jpg)

when you want to build a dapp that has custom data to store and query, you have two choices at currently

1st. use a centralized data architecture .e.g firebase or MongoDB to store the custom data. this is friendly for developers but will break the law of decentralization

2nd. use Ethereum or other blockchains to store the custom data and use thegraph to index data. this can keep the decentralization but will cost a lot of engineering effort

with the db3 network, you can get both advantages of those two choices.

# Features

**Schemaless**

You can store your custom data to the db3 network without any changes

**High Performance**

Currently,decentralization means terrible performance, but DB3 is trying to improve significantly:
* [Merkdb](https://github.com/dbpunk-labs/db3/issues/100) is the storage engine of the DB3 network, and it has high performance and also fast-proof generation. 
* Geo distribution: the nodes in every storage shard are geo-distributed, and the clients can execute queries against the nearest storage node.
* [Query session](./docs/query.md), the first decentralized query protocol to resolve performance and incentive perfectly.

**Data Ownership**

We proposed [the document level ownership](https://github.com/dbpunk-labs/db3/issues/271), and every document has its owner, while only the owner who holds the private key can update/delete the record. DB3 network generates the proofs and provides signatures to prove the membership (db3 has the specific document) and ownership.

**Programmable**

Dapp developers can develop data processing contracts and deploy them to the DB3 network just like developing data backend in web2.

**Ethereum Guarded Security**

DB3 network is a layer2 network on Ethereum and Ethereum guards all the assets.

# Getting Started

### Start A Local Testnet

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dbpunk-labs/db3.git
cd db3 && bash install_env.sh && cargo build
# start localnet
cd tools &&  sh start_localnet.sh
```

### Start building

```typescript
/*
|----------------------------|
| use db3js open a database  |
|----------------------------|
*/

// build sign function
const sign = await getSign()

// build database factory
const dbFactory = new DB3Factory({
    node: 'http://127.0.0.1:26659',
    sign,
    nonce
})

// open database with an address
const db = dbFactory.open("0x5ca8d43c15fb366d80e221d11a34894eb0975da6")
```
